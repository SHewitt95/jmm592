		<h1>Loading CSV with D3.</h1>
		<p>Look in the console for logging info after the data loads.</p>
		<p>If you open the console after loading, you'll need to reload the page.</p>
		<p>We're printing the contents of the files to the screen here, just to show they load.
		<p class="csvdata"></p>

		<script>
				//Load in contents of CSV file
		d3.csv("data1.csv", function(data1) {

		    //Now CSV contents have been transformed into
		    //an array of JSON objects.
		    console.log("The first file is csv...")
		    //Log 'data' to the console, for verification.
		    console.log(data1);

		    var body = d3.select("body");

				data1.forEach(function(d) {
					body.append("p").text(d.Race + " " + d.year2000 + " " + d.year2012);
				})



		});


		// Notice that the objects look the same. d3.csv() parses rows as objects.
		// Also this is a good point to talk about scope and breakpoints.
